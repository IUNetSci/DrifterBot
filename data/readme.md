# Data Files

This folder contains:

1. All data files used to generate the final paper plots
1. Any external data used in the project
1. The [GenerateDataFiles.ipynb notebook](GenerateDataFiles.ipynb) extracts data from the project database and/or combine it with external data to generate the files for the final plots

*Note that all Tweet IDs and Twitter user IDs in the data files are masked.*

## Mapping

To run the [GenerateDataFiles.ipynb notebook](GenerateDataFiles.ipynb) you need to update the mapping between your drifters' real `screen_name` so the output files preserve their anonymity, and the mapping between bots and seeds. This should be performed at the beginning of the notebook in the variables `BOTS_RENAME` and `INIT_SEED_MAP`.

## Input data

+ ### Bot scores

The bot score retrieval is outside the scope of this project, so before generating the data for the plots, you need to provide the bot scores for the friends and followers of each seed and drifter. In this project, we gathered data from [Botometer](https://botometer.iuni.iu.edu/) using the API. The input file for our analysis is [connections_botscores.csv](connections_botscores.csv).

+ ### Ego Networks

The [GenerateDataFiles.ipynb notebook](GenerateDataFiles.ipynb) computes the political valences and the echo chamber measurements, and generates [anonymized ego networks](/data/ego_networks/). However, it requires the de-anonymized versions generated by the independet script [metric/generate_networks_for_each_bot.py](/metric/generate_networks_for_each_bot.py). Once generated, you need to update the variable `GLOB_TO_EGO_NET` in the [GenerateDataFiles.ipynb notebook](GenerateDataFiles.ipynb) to point to these ego-networks. The de-anonymized data should stay private in compliance with Twitter's policy.
